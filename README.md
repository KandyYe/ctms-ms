```

### Flowchart Description:
1. **User Request**: The process begins with a user sending a request to the system.
2. **ctms-gateway**:
   - The request first undergoes **Authentication** to verify the user's identity.
   - If authentication is **successful**, the request is forwarded to `ctms-core`.
   - If authentication **fails**, an "Access Denied" response is returned.
3. **ctms-core**:
   - Manages the core business logic of the system.
   - Utilizes the **WebSocket Server** for real-time communication.
   - Processes the request further and sends it to `ctms-db` and `ctms-task`.
4. **ctms-db**:
   - Handles data retrieval and storage operations.
5. **ctms-task**:
   - Schedules tasks and executes quantitative trading strategies.
6. **ctms-admin**:
   - Provides features such as real-time K-line charts and multi-account trading.
   - Performs administrative actions like data backup and system configuration.
7. **Response to User**:
   - The final processed result is sent back to the user through the user interface.
